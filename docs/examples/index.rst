HyperFit comes bundled with some real 2D and 3D astrophysics data. Click on the links below to have a look. These are the
same as those presented in `Robotham & Obreschkow 2015 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PASA...32...33R/abstract>`_ and
so the fits can be compared directly to the numbers in that paper.
